Sometimes, in journals, the abstract is limited to a short paragraph. Such a limitation makes writing abstracts for interdisciplinary research challenging. At the Institute for Advanced Studies in Basic Sciences (IASBS), there is no mandatory rule regarding the length of the abstract. However, keep in mind that the abstract should be the essence of your dissertation, and in many cases, achieving such a concise text requires effort and mastery over the content of the dissertation. Even the selection of keywords and their order needs meticulous attention. IASBS has entrusted the reviewers with the task of determining whether your effort has been sufficient.
